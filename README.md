# Banking System Project 🏦💳

Welcome to the **Banking System Project**! This project is a simple console-based banking system designed to simulate basic banking operations like creating accounts, depositing, withdrawing money, and checking account details. It includes features such as account number generation, secure PIN functionality, and saving account details to a text file for persistence.

## Features ✨

- **Account Creation**: Allows users to create a new account with a unique 16-digit account number and set a secure PIN. 🔑
- **Secure Transactions**: Users must input their PIN for every transaction (balance check, withdrawal, deposit). 🔒
- **Random Account Number Generation**: Accounts are assigned a randomly generated 16-digit number. 🏷️
- **Balance Management**: Users can deposit and withdraw money, with balance updates reflected immediately. 💰
- **Account Details**: Users can view their account information, including balance and transaction history. 📊
- **Data Persistence**: All account information is saved to a text file (`accounts.txt`) to persist even after the program ends. 💾

## Getting Started 🚀

### Prerequisites 📜

- C++ compiler (e.g., GCC or Visual Studio) 💻
- Basic knowledge of C++ programming 🧑‍💻

### Installation 🔧

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Saint-St/banking-system.git
cd banking-system
